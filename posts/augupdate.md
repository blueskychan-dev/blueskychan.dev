# Long time no see!
Hey, Mind here!

Iâ€™ve made a bunch of updates todayâ€”new random wallpapers and an updated profile avatar. And the big one: **comments** are now live on the blog!

Itâ€™s simple: Iâ€™m using [Utterances](https://utteranc.es), which runs on GitHub Issues. Youâ€™ll need a GitHub account to leave a comment.

More posts soon (when Iâ€™m in the mood ðŸ‘€).  
Also, check out my Fedora GNOME setup:
