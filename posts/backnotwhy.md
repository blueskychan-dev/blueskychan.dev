### This website is finally back up ðŸŽ‰
#### But not the same.
This website is back but with different name but why?

### Lose access to blueskychan.dev
A month ago, my domain **blueskychan.dev** expired, and unfortunately, I was going through a tough financial time, which meant I couldnâ€™t afford to renew it. Thatâ€™s why you might have noticed I switched to using **mind.notmycode.dev** for a while.

Yesterday, I decided to try renewing **blueskychan.dev** through my Namecheap dashboard, but to my surprise, I couldnâ€™t find my domain anywhere.  
![Where did it go?](/abcdefg/lost.png)

It seems like Iâ€™ll need to contact Namecheap support to recover it. Wish me luck!

On another note, Iâ€™m considering moving to **Cloudflare Registrar** because theyâ€™re much [cheaper than Namecheap!](https://tld-list.com/tld/dev)

### The effect of losing access
Iâ€™ve updated my contact email and website! If you wish to contact me via email, my new address is [hello@mindhas403.dev](mailto:hello@mindhas403.dev).  

This email is now my primary contact address, and Iâ€™m always happy to reply to your messages!
