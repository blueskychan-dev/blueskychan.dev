# I'm Done with Crazy Error

I'm quitting Crazy Error completely. But why?

## What Is Crazy Error?

First, let's understand what Crazy Error is. It's a subgenre of YTPMV (YouTube Poop Music Video). The concept involves editing videos to look like chaotic Windows OS errors, often including message boxes, sound effects, background music (commonly *IOSYS – Marisa Stole the Precious Thing*), and usually ending with a blue screen.

The exact origins are unclear, but it likely started in Hong Kong or Taiwan, with the first known video titled *Windows XP Crazy Error*. It became popular in regions like Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.

## How Are Crazy Errors Made?

Before 2013, most Crazy Errors were created using Adobe Flash. Nowadays, creators prefer tools like Adobe Premiere Pro or Vegas Pro for video editing, and REAPER for audio. Some use CapCut or other apps, but those are less common due to difficulty or limited features.

In the past, screen captures were done using Windows Snipping Tool or similar tools. From 2020 onward, tools like AeroRec or CppShot became more common.

## Why Do People Like Crazy Error?

If you enjoy YTPMVs, Crazy Error appeals for similar reasons. For some (like me), ADHD plays a role in enjoying this fast, chaotic content. It humorously exaggerates Windows’ flaws—almost like showing the OS can crash in absurd ways.

## Can Crazy Errors Be Different?

Absolutely. Many creators do collabs or use alternative background music, different OS themes (like Linux or macOS), and new styles beyond the original IOSYS format.

## What’s Wrong with the Crazy Error Community?

Honestly, the community is a mess. It's filled with unmanaged servers, immature mods, and a flood of kids making low-effort clones or stealing content without credit. Many try to act older to bypass age restrictions.

I was banned from a server (Fighter’s) after applying for mod—just because I was 14 at the time. They claimed I was "underage and annoying." It felt unfair.

Appealing bans is hard. Some people still falsely accuse me of carding or illegal activity without evidence, making unbanning nearly impossible. I'm not the only one affected—many face the same issues in this toxic and poorly moderated environment.

Still, not *everyone* is bad.

## What Does This Mean?

If I haven't finished a Crazy Error collab with you, I’m likely not going to. I'm officially quitting the scene.

I'll keep my old Crazy Error videos online (on YouTube and other platforms), but I won't be making new ones. I enjoy learning about Linux, Android, and tech stuff way more now. Crazy Error started worsening my ADHD, and the toxic community just made everything worse. I’ve had enough.

## Thank You

Thanks for all the support. I know many of you followed me since my early Crazy Error days (as Fusenice) or during my cringier moments. But we all grow up—and it’s time for me to move on.

See you around. <3
