### Move on from fusemeow.me to blueskychan.dev

Now i just move on from fusemeow.me to blueskychan.dev, here is why:

- 1. Performance:
     Because old blueskychan website (aka fusemeow.me) is kinda use gif image to animated background and it make some devices like older phones/potato devices can crash easily, it why we move on!
- 2. Design:
     The old one, i use staic html and css but this new version now, they are use next.js to design all of website, also this one is just image (not gif like old one) so now it look better!
- 3. Backend System:
     The old one is hosted on github pages, but due to this version use next.js, now we move on to use a vercel for hosting the website! Also we have a blog system, so they need to use next.js too!

> However, fusemeow.me will hosted until 7 January 2024, and it will be gone!, but osu!collab image will be hosted in here soon!

Also Thanks you for all support! :3
