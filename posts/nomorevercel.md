Hey, Mind here! 👋

I’m proud to announce that **mindhas403.dev** (this website!) has officially moved from **Vercel** to **TechTransThai.org!** 🎉

Now the website points to **Cloudflare proxy → TechTransThai**, not **76.76.21.21** anymore.
I want to give a huge thanks to [@latenightdef](https://pongpeeraw.techtransthai.org) for helping me out and offering **free hosting** for my site!

## But why? What’s wrong with Vercel?

Back on **September 29, 2025**, the CEO of Vercel tweeted something - my friend sent it to me:

It seems that Vercel’s CEO took a photo showing support for the **Prime Minister of Israel**, and… well, you probably know what’s going on right now - *the war.*

To be honest, I’m not really into politics or wars, but this was just too much.
Since my girlfriend and my friends also don’t support the Israeli side - and with Vercel being, well, kinda disappointing lately - I decided to reach out to [@latenightdef](https://pongpeeraw.techtransthai.org).
She kindly said, *“no problem!”* and helped me move everything. Thank you again! <3

## Will the website be slower now?

A bit, yeah.
Moving from an **anycast** setup to a **single server in Thailand** means slightly higher latency for visitors outside Asia. But with **Cloudflare’s proxy**, it should be a bit better overall.

Anyway, that’s all for this post.
Thanks for reading - see you in the next one! 👋💻
