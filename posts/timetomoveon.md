# Archiving My Old Projects: A Chapter Ends

> 📌 tl;dr: I'm officially archiving all my "for educational purpose" DDoS/DoS tools on GitHub. These projects helped me learn programming, but I’ve outgrown them and no longer want them associated with my identity. Time to move on.

Well, it's finally time to talk about something that's been on my mind for a while:
I'm going to archive my old projects—especially the ones related to DDoS/DoS tools created for so-called "educational purposes."

## 🧠 Why This Matters

You might wonder: Why archive these now?

Let me explain the journey that brought me here, and why I think it’s time to move forward.

## 📖 The Beginning

Back in the days of "fusenice" (~2020), I didn’t even own a computer. I used my phone and connected to remote desktops from Thai cloud providers like Xver and DriteStudio to experience Windows and explore programming.

That’s when I discovered Python—it looked fun! I started learning but quickly lost interest. I wasn’t serious about it back then.

Fast-forward to 2021: I became curious about DDoS attacks after seeing services like MCStresser. I had no clue what I was doing—my first "tool" was literally a batch file running ping in a loop. Around this time, I also moved to Vultr and Azure.

Later in 2021, I got my first laptop (Core i3-330M, 4GB DDR3, 250GB HDD) for online classes. That’s when I seriously started learning to code again. I discovered C#—and for some reason, it just clicked. I also dabbled in C++ and Linux while trying to make better (but still pretty bad) attack tools.

Ironically, building those tools pushed me to learn how to code. I was constantly Googling, experimenting, and debugging.

## 💬 About Those Tools

Yes, you’ve probably seen the many DDoS/DoS tools on my GitHub. Some of you even followed me because of them.

One tool that got attention was DDoSPacket, which I made before I even started middle school. Looking back—it was terrible, I agree. I could write a much better version today, but...

## 🧹 Time to Move On

I’ve considered rewriting DDoSPacket and similar tools for years—but now, I’ve decided to archive them entirely. Here's why:

- 🧨 My identity has been unfairly tied to these tools. People call me an "attacker" without any proof—even when I’ve done nothing wrong.
- ❌ The "educational purpose" label doesn’t help. Many people still misuse these tools—I've even received Telegram DMs from people using them to attack PUBG servers.
- 🚫 I don’t want legal or personal risks. It’s 2025, I’m in high school now, and I’ve got responsibilities, schoolwork, and teachers to deal with. I don’t want to be dragged down by an old repo.
- ❤️ I’ve outgrown that phase. These days, I find real joy in learning Linux, C, and Rust.

## 🫂 Final Words

Writing those tools taught me a lot. They helped me grow and become who I am today—a true computer enjoyer.

But everything has its time—and that time is over.

If you still want to mess around, you can probably find Termux scripts online. But I won’t support or help with anything related to DDoS anymore.
